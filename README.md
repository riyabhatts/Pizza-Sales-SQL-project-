🍕 SQL Data Analysis Project: Pizza Sales Performance

💡 Project Snapshot

This project is an end-to-end SQL portfolio piece analyzing a historical pizza sales dataset. I utilized advanced MySQL techniques to derive actionable business insights, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and inform operational strategy.

🛠️ Key Technologies & Skills

Database: MySQL Workbench

Core Skills: Multi-Table JOINs, Complex Aggregation, Sub-queries.

Advanced Skills: Proficiency in Window Functions (RANK(), PARTITION BY, SUM() OVER).

Data Model: Successfully analyzed a four-table relational schema (orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types).

🎯 Top Business Insights

1. Total Revenue: Generated over $817K in sales across 21,350 orders.

2. Peak Operations: Busiest ordering periods occur during the 12 PM - 1 PM lunch rush and the 4 PM - 7 PM dinner window.

3. High-Value Products: The Thai Chicken Pizza is the top revenue generator overall.

4. Average no of pizzas order per day is 138.

5. Category Ranking: Used the RANK() function to determine the Top 3 best-selling pizzas within each category (e.g., Veggie, Classic, Supreme), providing a segmented view of product success.

6. Time-Series: Calculated Cumulative Revenue growth to track performance over the year.
